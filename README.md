This repository has the code used for Machine Learning on the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset from the UCI website: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Pima+Indians+Diabetes

The 'pima-indians-diabetes.csv' file needs to be loaded on computer for the code to function.

The title of each .py file gives an abbreviated indication of the classification method that file incorporates.  The more detailed classification is according to the following:
1) KNearest.py    ==> k-Nearest Neighbor
2) NaiveBayes.py  ==> Naive Bayes
3) MaxLiklhood.py ==> Maximum Likelihood
